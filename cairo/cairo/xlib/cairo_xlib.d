/**
 * This package contains functionality pertaining to cairo's
 * XLib support.  Obviously, this package isn't much good
 * on anything but a Windows machine.
 *
 * Currently, since there does not appear to be any standard XLib library for
 * D, this binding defines manual typedefs for the types it needs.  You may
 * like to replace the contents of the file 'cairo_xlib_types.d' with a public
 * import statement to the library you wish to use.
