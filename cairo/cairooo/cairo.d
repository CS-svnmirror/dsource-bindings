/**
    This module provides functions for loading the cairo library at runtime,
    and for checking what version of the cairo library has been loaded.

    When using the cairooo binding, you need to call the appropriate load
    function for each package before using it.  You may also optionally pass
    the name of the library to load the package's functionality from, although
    this should be autodetected by the binding based on your operating system.

Examples:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
import std.stdio;
import cairooo.all;

void main()
{
    // Loads the cairooo binding using the default library location
    Cairo.load();

    // Displays the version of the loaded cairo library.
    writefln("cairo version: %s", Cairo.cairoVersionString);
}

    Params:
        libName = The path to load the cairo library from.  Depending on your
                  system, this need not be an absolute pathname.  Generally,
                  provided that the library is on your system PATH or LIBPATH,
                  then the name of the library should be sufficient.

                  For example, on Windows you might use "libcairo-2.dll",
                  whilst linux users might use "libcairo-2.so".
