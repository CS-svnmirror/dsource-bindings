     * Wraps the low-level cairo pattern in a new object.  This method is most

     * slightly dangerous and can lead to memory leaks if misused (see below).

     * Please note that it is $(I vitally) important that you use the takeref
     * parameter correctly.  If takeref is set to true, then the
     * object will $(I not) add to the handle's reference count.  This means
     * that if you do not pass the correct value for takeref, then you could
     * end up with handles either not being destroyed, or being destroyed too
     * early!
