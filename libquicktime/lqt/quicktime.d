 * Then use \ref lqt_decode_audio_track to decode noninterleaved channels in either 16bit integer
 * or floating point [-1.0..1.0] format. This method will convert all internally used formats to the datatypes
 * you want, but won't output the full precision for 24/32 bit formats. If you want the samples as raw as possible

 * The audio API changed a lot during the last years (causing lot of confusion), so here is the

 * Once you found a codec (i.e. a \ref lqt_codec_info_t ), call \ref lqt_add_audio_track to

 *
 * Next you might want to set some compression parameters. This is done by calling \ref lqt_set_audio_parameter.
 * Supported parameters and valid ranges are in the \ref lqt_codec_info_t.

 * For each track, encode noninterleaved samples (either in 16bit integer
 * or floating point [-1.0..1.0] format) with \ref lqt_encode_audio_track . In this case, libquicktime

 * setups.
 *
 *  When decoding, simply get the channel setup with \ref lqt_get_channel_setup.
 *  It can happen, that this function returns NULL when no specific mapping is known.
 *
 *  When encoding, things are more complicated. Some codecs have fixed channel
 *  setups. After setting up an audio track, call \ref lqt_get_channel_setup to
 *  check, if there is already a prefefined channel setup. If this is the case (i.e. if non
 *  NULL is returned), you MUST use this  channel setup.
 *
 *  If there is no predefined setup (i.e. \ref lqt_get_channel_setup returns NULL after
 *  creation of the audio track), call \ref lqt_set_channel_setup to set your desired
 *  setup. It can happen, that libquicktime will reorder the channel setup. Thus
 *  you need a final call to \ref lqt_get_channel_setup to know the whole truth.

 * \ingroup video

 * for each track you want to decode, use \ref quicktime_supported_video to verify that a codec
 * is available. Then for each track, get the frame size with \ref quicktime_video_width and
 * \ref quicktime_video_height . The framerate is only exact when handled as a rational number.
 * Thus, you'll need 2 functions \ref lqt_video_time_scale and \ref lqt_frame_duration .
 * The framerate in frames/sec becomes time_scale/frame_duration. Further format information can
 * be obtained with \ref lqt_get_pixel_aspect, \ref lqt_get_interlace_mode and \ref lqt_get_chroma_placement.
 *
 * A very important thing is the colormodel (see \ref color): First obtain the colormodel used natively
 * by the codec with \ref lqt_get_cmodel. Your application might or might not support all colormodels,
 * which exist in libquicktime. The more colormodels you can handle yourself, the better, since libquicktimes
 * built in colormodel converter is not the best. Thus, it's the best idea to pack all colormodels you
 * can handle yourself into an array, and call \ref lqt_get_best_colormodel to get the best colormodel. After you
 * figured out, which colormodel you use, tell this to libquicktime with \ref lqt_set_cmodel.
 *
 * When decoding frames, libquicktime by default assumes, that the frames you pass to it have no padding bytes
 * between the scanlines. Some APIs however padd scanlines to certain boundaries. If this is the case, you must
 * tell this to libquicktime by calling \ref lqt_set_row_span and \ref lqt_set_row_span_uv (for planar formats).
 *
 * Then, for each frame, it's wise to get the timestamp with \ref lqt_frame_time before decoding it. This will
 * make sure, that you'll support tracks with nonconstant framerates. The actual decoding then should happen with
 * \ref lqt_decode_video.
