This code works was tested both windows and linux and works. I've included the raknet source I based my code off of 
for both windows and linux.

Allows use of bitstreams and RPC, comes with a chat sample and a networked opengl 
line drawing sample using my 2D game framework & derelict, based upon irrlicht's Raknet example.

I started this 'binding' in order to get the C++ version of raknet to work with D. 

These should please both windows and linux users.

Have a nice day,
