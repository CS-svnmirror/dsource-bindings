These are the D bindings for Portaudio. http://www.portaudio.com 
It's a cross platform audio API for audio input and output on
atleast Linux, Windows and OS X.

Portaudio is licenced with an MIT style licence. http://www.portaudio.com/license.html
These bindings and the included sine wave example are also released under that same
licence.

This version of the bindings is tested and made using Portaudio v19.

Tango was used for a couple of Stdouts and PI.
You could easily change them to Phobos equivalents.
