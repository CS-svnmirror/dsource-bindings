0. Disclaimer
=============

These bindings have only been tested in a Debian/Linux (x32) environment using
gdc. If you have successfully run them on Windows or Mac or whatever, simply
contact me and I'll add appropriate comments to this file; or you might change
this file on your own and submit it via SVN.



1. Remarks
==========

This version really is beta! If you want to or are using these bindings and
experience erros and have fixed them, feel free to add them either directly
via SVN to the bindings project[1] or you might find me on #d or #d.tango on
freenode or post in the forums. Of corse you can also contact me via email.

Since I am currently writing my diploma thesis I might not have the time to
really test _all_ functions so there really might be errors...



2. Builld & Install
===================

I built this library with the help of dsss[2] a really great tool you should
consider using, if you are not by now. Writing Makefiles is obsolete with it.
If you have dsss installed you simply type in the main directory

	$ dsss build

In order to install the library correctly just type

	$ dsss install

If you (one day) do not need the library anymore just uninstall it using

	$ dsss uninstall gsl



3. Testing
==========

I have added the first basic testing routines to the test directory. Again
there is a dsss.conf file allowing you to build the testing program on your
own:

	$ dsss build

and then run

	$ ./testgsl

If you want to help me do the testing, simply add routines to the
"test/test/main.d" file. It's a bit annoying for the moment but I couldn't
find a more less usefull testing environment for now, it will probably change
in the future.



4. Using the library
====================

If you simply want to use the library with your own program and have
successfully install the library with dsss, add the following line to your
dsss.conf file:

	buildflags = -L-lgsl -L-lblas

Of corse you need the real libraries installed on your machine. On Debian
based systems search for libgsl and libblas.

If you have done this, you should be able to simply add import statements
similar to the "#include <gsl/gsl_*.h>" statements from the documentation.
You only have to change the import from "gsl/*" to "gsl.*" ommiting the ".h"
in the end.
